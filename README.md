## 1. RNA-Seq analysis

### 1.1 Raw data

Raw RNA-Seq data-sets can be retrieved from **GSE157128**. Arabidopsis thaliana* plants were germinated with the synthetic communities (SynComs) in the presence or absence of 1 ÂµM flg22 and incubated for 14 days before harvesting. For *pWER::FLS2-GFP* plants, single-end RNA-Seq experiments were conducted for 4 conditions (3 biological replicates for each condition). For Col-0 plants, pair-end RNA-Seq experiments were conducted for 10 conditions (4 biological replicates for each condition).

### 1.2 Pre-procession

Raw Illumina RNA-Seq reads were pre-processed using fastp (v0.19.10) [1] with default settings for paired-end (Col-0 experiment) or single-end reads (*pWER::FLS2-GFP* experiment). For single-end reads, low quality sequences from the head (8 bases) and tail (2 bases) were trimmed. 

Scripts include [script_trim.sh](RNA-Seq_scripts/script_trim.sh).

### 1.3 Pseudo-alignment

High quality reads were pseudo-aligned to TAIR 10 *Arabidopsis thaliana* transcriptome reference (Ensembl)[2] using kallisto (v0.46.1)[3]. 

Scripts include [script_alignment.sh](RNA-Seq_scripts/script_alignment.sh).

Results include [align_data](align_data) for *pWER::FLS2-GFP* and [align_data_1stadd](align_data_1stadd) for Col-0.
